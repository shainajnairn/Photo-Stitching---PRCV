Photo Stitching Project using R2D2 Feature Detection
This project aims to stitch together two images using feature matching and homography estimation. The core of the approach leverages the R2D2 feature detection model, a robust detector that can extract keypoints and descriptors across various scales and orientations, to perform efficient image stitching.
